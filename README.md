### 1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preprocessing**

> *"Handling messy, large-scale educational datasets efficiently."*

**Tasks:**

* Scraped educational content (e.g., course catalogs) using `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`.
* Preprocessed text data: handled missing values, normalized content using `Pandas`.
* Scaled preprocessing for millions of records using `Dask` or `Apache Spark`.

**Tools & Tech:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `Dask`, `PostgreSQL`
**Outcome:** Built a robust, scalable data ingestion pipeline for diverse content sources.

---

### 2️⃣ **Model Development**

> *"Designing ML/GenAI models to power adaptive learning and intelligent content."*

**Tasks:**

* Built a **recommendation system** using collaborative filtering (Matrix Factorization).
* Integrated **LLMs** (e.g., `Hugging Face Transformers`) to auto-generate quizzes and summaries.
* Applied `Optuna` for model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

**Tools & Tech:** `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`/`PyTorch`, `Optuna`, `Transformers`
**Outcome:** Delivered high-performing, personalized learning models and dynamic NLP tools.

---

### 3️⃣ **Model Evaluation & Validation**

> *"Ensuring model quality through rigorous, metrics-driven evaluation."*

**Tasks:**

* Performed cross-validation, used `precision@K` and `recall@K` for recommendation accuracy.
* Evaluated LLM outputs using `BLEU scores` and human-quality benchmarks.
* Tracked experiments and versioned models via `MLflow`.

**Tools & Tech:** `Scikit-learn`, `MLflow`, custom evaluation metrics
**Outcome:** Reliable models with measurable performance, avoiding overfitting and bias.

---

### 4️⃣ **Deployment**

> *"Serving models with real-time inference and cloud-native scalability."*

**Tasks:**

* Deployed models as APIs using `FastAPI`.
* Containerized with `Docker`, deployed on `AWS SageMaker` or `Google Cloud AI Platform`.
* Ensured low-latency inference for user-facing applications.

**Tools & Tech:** `FastAPI`, `Docker`, `AWS/GCP`, `CI/CD pipelines`
**Outcome:** Production-grade deployment with minimal latency and maximum uptime.

---

### 5️⃣ **Monitoring & Maintenance**

> *"Keeping the system healthy with automated checks and retraining pipelines."*

**Tasks:**

* Implemented real-time monitoring using `Prometheus` + `Grafana`.
* Automated model retraining and ETL tasks using `Apache Airflow`.
* Detected data drift using statistical hypothesis testing.

**Tools & Tech:** `Prometheus`, `Grafana`, `Airflow`, `Python scripts`
**Outcome:** Proactive model health checks and continuous improvement pipeline.
