# Project Progress Summary

This document outlines the step-by-step progress made on the **Educational Data Science Platform** project.

## Completed Checkpoints:

### 1. Project Initialization & Environment Setup

*   **Directory Structure:** Established a clear and organized directory structure, creating essential folders like `data/`, `src/` (with subdirectories for `data_collection/`, `preprocessing/`, `model_development/`, etc.), `notebooks/`, `config/`, `tests/`, and `docs/`. This ensures a modular and maintainable codebase.
*   **Dependency Management (`requirements.txt`):** Created and populated `requirements.txt` with all the necessary Python libraries for the project. This included core data science libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, dask), web scraping tools (beautifulsoup4, lxml, requests), database connectors (psycopg2-binary, asyncpg, python-dotenv), AI/ML frameworks (huggingface_hub, transformers, optuna, torch), web API tools (fastapi, uvicorn), containerization (docker), and ML lifecycle management (mlflow, kaggle). This file is crucial for reproducible environments.
*   **Project Documentation (`README.md`):** A `README.md` file was created at the project root to store your comprehensive project outline, detailing the five main workflows and their components. This serves as the central documentation for the project.
*   **Environment Verification:** Confirmed that the basic Python environment and core libraries (like pandas and PyTorch) were correctly installed and functioning within your system.

### 2. Production-Grade Database Setup

*   **Secure Configuration (`config/.env`):** To manage sensitive database credentials securely and portably, we instructed you to create a `.env` file in the `config/` directory. We then generated a strong, random password for your database user and guided you to manually update your `.env` file with this password. This ensures credentials are not hardcoded and can be easily managed across different environments.
*   **Database and User Provisioning (`deployment/init_db.sql`):** We created a SQL script (`init_db.sql`) that defines commands to create your dedicated PostgreSQL database (`learning_platform_db`) and a specific user (`learning_user`) with appropriate permissions. This sets up the foundational database structure.
*   **Initial Database Schema (SQLAlchemy ORM - `src/data_engineering/database_models.py`):** We implemented the full database schema using SQLAlchemy ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). This involved defining Python classes for `User`, `Course`, `Content`, `LearningProgress`, `Assessment`, `AssessmentResult`, and `Interaction`, complete with their respective columns, data types, and relationships. This provides a Pythonic way to interact with your database.
*   **Robust Database Utilities (`src/data_engineering/db_utils.py`):** A `db_utils.py` script was developed to encapsulate robust database interaction logic. This includes:
    *   **Connection Pooling:** Efficiently manages database connections to improve performance and resource utilization.
    *   **Retry Logic:** Automatically retries failed database operations with exponential backoff, enhancing resilience.
    *   **Health Checks:** A function to verify the database connection status, crucial for monitoring.
    *   **Dynamic Credential Loading:** Configured to load database credentials dynamically from your `config/.env` file.
*   **Database Migrations (Alembic):**
    *   **Initialization:** We initialized Alembic, a powerful database migration tool, which created the `alembic/` directory and `alembic.ini` configuration file.
    *   **Configuration:** We then configured `alembic.ini` and `alembic/env.py` to correctly integrate with your PostgreSQL database (using environment variables) and to recognize your SQLAlchemy ORM models as the source of truth for schema definition.
    *   **Migration Generation & Application:** We generated the *initial* migration script, which contained the SQL commands to create all the tables defined in `database_models.py`. Subsequently, we generated *another* migration to add the `url` column to the `Course` model, as it was missing from the initial definition. Both migrations were successfully applied to your database.
*   **Database Verification:** We meticulously verified the successful creation of all tables in your PostgreSQL database using `psql` commands, confirming that the schema matches your SQLAlchemy models.

### 3. Data Collection and Preprocessing (Initial Steps)

*   **Web Scraping Module (`src/data_collection/web_scraper.py`):** We created `web_scraper.py` with functions to fetch HTML content from URLs using `requests` and parse it efficiently using `BeautifulSoup` and the `lxml` parser. This provides the foundation for acquiring educational content.
*   **Data Ingestion Module (`src/data_collection/data_ingestion.py`):** We developed `data_ingestion.py` to handle the flow of scraped data into the database. It includes:
    *   **Data Validation:** Basic checks to ensure the scraped data conforms to expected formats before ingestion.
    *   **Duplicate Prevention:** Logic to prevent re-ingestion of already existing courses (based on URL).
    *   **Database Integration:** Uses the `db_utils.py` and `database_models.py` to store course data into the `courses` table.
    *   **Successful Ingestion Test:** We successfully ran this script, which scraped a sample URL (Coursera's homepage) and inserted a dummy course entry into your database, demonstrating the end-to-end data collection pipeline.
*   **Data Preprocessing Module (`src/preprocessing/data_preprocessor.py`):** We created `data_preprocessor.py` to prepare raw data for model training. This module performs:
    *   **Data Retrieval:** Fetches course data from the PostgreSQL database into a pandas DataFrame.
    *   **Basic Cleaning:** Fills missing values (e.g., descriptions with empty strings), converts text to lowercase for consistency, and handles potential duplicates.
    *   **Feature Engineering:** Adds a simple feature, `description_length`, as an example of extracting useful information from raw data.
    *   **Successful Preprocessing Test:** We successfully ran this script, confirming that it could fetch, clean, and add features to the ingested course data.

## Next Steps:

We are now ready to continue with **Phase 2: Model Development**, specifically focusing on building and refining the recommendation model.
